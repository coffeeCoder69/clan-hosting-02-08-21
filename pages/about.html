            communities of your Superfans. <br>

            We believe that the Future of Social is Community, and Creators should be able to have a steady stream of

            that allows you to leverage that advantage is the need of the hour. <br>

            allows you to build a community around it and interact with your followers. <br> <br>

            <b> FAQ- </b><br> <br>

            <b> Why use Clan? I can easily use existing platforms</b> <br> <br>

            Clan is an amalgamation of various features giving you a simplistic All-in-one platform that is accessible
            to
            more users and will allow you to diversify. Our aim is to simplify the experience for Creators as well as
            their
            audience. <br>

            <br> <b> But will my audience Pay for my content? </b><br> <br>

            - People pay for subscriptions because it enhances their trust in the quality of the content. This trust
            comes
            largely from their positioning as a quality brand. <br>
            - People who are passionate about a subject like to mix and talk with other people who have the same level
            of
            passion. They will pay to be part of a community of peers or fellow enthusiasts. <br>
            - People pay for exclusivity! They get pleasure and value out of having access to information and people
            that
            other people don’t. It is a similar phenomenon to private member clubs in the offline world. <br><br>
